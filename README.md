## Caveats

There are a few issues that should be fixed before taking this into production use:

* Fix the [mass assignment vulnerabilities](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#mass-assignment) (this is the most important thing)
  * Rails 3.0: `ActiveRecord::Base.send(:attr_accessible, nil)`
  * Rails 3.1: `config.active_record.whitelist_attributes = true`
  * Rails 3.2: `config.active_record.mass_assignment_sanitizer = :strict`
* Upgrade to a more recent Rails version (in other words, Rails 3.2.x)
* Remove the Mailchimp integration
* Remove the Zendesk integration

There is a `rails_upgrade` branch where some of this work has been started and pull requests are definitely welcome.
