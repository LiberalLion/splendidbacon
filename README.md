## Caveats

There are a few issues that should be fixed before taking this into production use:

* Fix the mass assignment vulnerabilities (this is the most important thing)
* Upgrade to a more recent Rails version (in other words, Rails 3.2.x)
* Remove the Mailchimp integration
* Remove the Zendesk integration

## Installation (for development)

1. Clone the repository

    `git clone git@github.com:kiskolabs/splendidbacon.git`

2. Check that you have the right ruby version (> 1.9.2)

3. Install the required gems

    `bundle install`

    in development you might want to also pass `--without production`

4. Create database.yml in the config folder. You can `cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml` to get a starting point.

5. Setup the database (create DB, load schema, load seed data)

    `rake db:setup`

6. Start the app

    `rails server`
